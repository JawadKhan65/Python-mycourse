# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
# lista = ["apple", "mango", "banana", 'apple'] e.g "apple"

# list are ordered
# When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
# lists are mutable mean changable

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
# we can also use a constructor to create a list like below
lst = list(("apple", True, 123, "sae a boss"))
