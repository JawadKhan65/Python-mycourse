# string data type is actually a sequence of characters
# enclosed in single quotes '' or double quotes ""

name = "jawad"
print(name)

quote = 'khan'
print(quote)
# we can us it in f"" in order to use single and double quotes in it like
# because in many cases like we want to use an apostropy in a string than if there are single quotes there will be an error

# example = 'jawad's' this will show error but we can use double quote to use single quote within it or vice versa
example1 = "jawad's car"
example2 = 'jawad "what are you doing"'

# another way is to use f string in it we can also use variables will discuss later


# Also one more data type is boolean True or False it simple return the no or Yes value
