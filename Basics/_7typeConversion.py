# As we studied that there are 3 main or basic data types 
# int flaot comlex and string we can convert there types as follow
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
cd = str(x)

print(type(cd))
