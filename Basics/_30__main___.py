import dadoscrata as d

# i can use all the functions in the dadoscrata file
# now in terminal run this file by typing python _30main.py it will run 
# imported file it means that anything written in that file can spoil u if
# there is sumthing suspicious in that file
# so to avoid that
#  we can add a code __name__ == __main__    to that file we are importing 
# this code is defined as if the file is running from orignal location 
# accessing from e.g dadoscrata then the code inside it will run
# other wise it will not run automatically we will call what we needed


#  note also check dadoscrata.py file
