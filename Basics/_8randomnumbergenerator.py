# pythom provide us built-in module called random to generate random number

# first we have to import 
import random
# this code will generate a random number between one and 10

print(random.randrange(1,10))
# we can practice range between as we want example  below

print(random.randrange(7,1550))
# and one thing more called choice
x = ["a", "bv", "dd"]

print(random.choice(x))
# this will pick up a number from given list style
